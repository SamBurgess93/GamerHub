## UX 
### Project Goals
The scope of this project is to create a user centric website using the Flask, Python, MongoDB and Heroku.
 
This is my third Milestone Project that must be developed as part of my Full Stack software development course with Code Institute.

The primary goal of the GamerHUB website is to create a community of likeminded people with similar interests to collaborate and share information and experiences with games they have played. Registered users can leave reviews of games they have played.
